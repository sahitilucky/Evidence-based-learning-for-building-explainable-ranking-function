# Explainable ranking function using Evidence based learning
This is the code repository for the explainable ranking model based on evidence-based learning approach.

**Description:** We learn an explainable ranknig function from search logs based on probabilistic models and learning to rank methods. This approach is also used to generate explainable content-matching features that are added to LTR models to improve performance and explainability.[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HYOiPd6RFa9J9rmneGSLpESh2d7s_FO/view?usp=sharing)
